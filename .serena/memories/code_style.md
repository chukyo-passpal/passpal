- TypeScript-first codebase targeting React Native/Expo 54 with React 19; uses Expo Router file-based routing.
- Linting relies on `eslint-config-expo` flat config; no custom rules besides ignoring `dist/`.
- UI components leverage Tamagui and Storybook stories; keep components typed and reuse domain models/services from `src`.
- Follow existing folder boundaries (data/domain/presentation) when adding features.
